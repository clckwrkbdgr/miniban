Miniban - a clone of Sokoban game.

THE GAME
========

The goal of the game is to place all items onto special placeholders.
Items can be pushed, but not pulled.
Item can be pushed only until hits a wall or another box, so two boxes in a row cannot be moved.
Hero can move only in four basic directions, so no diagonal movement avail.
